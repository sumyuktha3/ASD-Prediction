### PREDICTING AUTISTIC SPECTRUM DISORDER USING MACHINE LEARNING (KNN)

## ABSTRACT

Autistic Spectrum Disorder (ASD) refers to a group of developmental disorders that affect the nervous system. Some of the most common ASD symptoms include impairment, challenges in social interaction, and repetitive behaviour that affect communication. ASD has a significant impact on health care not only due to the number of ASD cases raising but also the time involved to diagnose ASD. Early identification and intervention of ASD can lead to better outcomes and improved quality of life for affected individuals. However, screening for ASD can be time-consuming and costly, requiring extensive evaluations by health care professionals. In recent years, machine learning techniques have shown great promise in aiding the screening and diagnosis of ASD. This project proposes a method for predicting ASD using the K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN) algorithm. KNN is a non-parametric classification algorithm that is widely used in various fields due to its simplicity and effectiveness. The proposed method involves extracting features from behavioral data collected from a standardized diagnostic tool, the Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule (ADOS). The extracted features are then used to train the KNN model. The proposed method was evaluated on a data set of individuals, consisting of 21 attributes.The adult data set contains 704 instances,children data set contains 292 instances and adolescent contains 104 instances The data set was randomly split into training and testing sets, with 70% of the data used for training and 30% for testing. Through this accuracy of the model is obtained.

## OBJECTIVE

# 1> 
The objective for autism prediction using KNN machine learning algorithm is to build a predictive model that can accurately classify individuals as either having autism or not based on a set of input features.
# 2>
KNN (K-Nearest Neighbors) is a supervised machine learning algorithm that can be used for classification tasks. It works by finding the K-nearest neighbors to a given data point and classifying it based on the majority class of those neighbors. 
# 3>
To apply KNN for autism prediction, we would need to collect data on individuals with and without autism and select relevant features that are likely to be predictive of autism. Examples of such features could include age, gender, family history of autism, social interaction skills, communication skills, and repetitive behaviors.
# 4>
Once we have collected and pre-processed the data, we can train a KNN model on a subset of the data and test its performance on a separate validation set. The model's accuracy can then be evaluated using metrics such as precision, recall, and F1 score. The goal is to achieve a high accuracy rate so that the model can be used to predict autism in new individuals with a high degree of confidenc
